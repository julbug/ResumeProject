      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>The Mixologist app is a web-based cocktail recipe application that allows users to create a wide variety of drink recipes. Whether you're a professional bartender or a cocktail enthusiast, Mixologist provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to discover and experiment with cocktails.</p>
    <p>Future features of this app will include an extensive collection of drink recipes from classic cocktails to modern creations. Users can browse through categories, search for specific drinks, and access detailed recipe instructions and ingredient lists. Each recipe includes information on the drink's preparation method, garnish options, and serving glassware.</p>
    <p>One of the standout features of Mixologist is its customization functionality. Users can create their own personalized cocktails by selecting ingredients from a comprehensive list, specifying quantities, and even adding custom notes. This empowers users to unleash their creativity and craft unique drink creations tailored to their taste preferences.</p>
    <p>Mixologist is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is designed using modern web development techniques and frameworks, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing experience across different devices and screen sizes. The app retrieves and stores data using a server-side backend and utilizes client-side JavaScript for dynamic interactivity and seamless user interactions.</p>
