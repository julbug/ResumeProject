      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>The Eco Hub website is a comprehensive platform dedicated to promoting environmental awareness and providing resources for sustainable living. It utilizes AI technology to determine if a species is invasive in Florida, starting with plants, and aims to expand its database to include other species such as mammals, birds, reptiles, and more.</p>
      <p>The website offers an intuitive interface where users can input the name of a plant species and receive instant feedback on whether it is considered invasive in Florida. The AI-powered system analyzes the input data, cross-references it with the existing database of invasive plant species, and provides users with accurate and relevant information.</p>
      <p>In addition to the species determination feature, the Eco Hub website serves as a hub of knowledge on invasive species in Florida. It provides educational resources and articles to raise awareness about the impact of invasive species on ecosystems and the importance of native biodiversity conservation.</p>
      <p>Future plans for the website include expanding the database to include a wide range of species beyond plants, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, and more. This expansion will allow users to access information and AI-based determinations for various types of organisms, helping them make informed decisions and contribute to the preservation of Florida's unique ecosystem.</p>
      <p>The Eco Hub website is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The AI functionality is implemented through machine learning algorithms and integration with AI frameworks. The website also utilizes a database system to store and retrieve information about invasive species in Florida.</p>
